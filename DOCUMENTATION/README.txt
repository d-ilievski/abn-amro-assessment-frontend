Frontend

Vue.js
For the frontend part of this application I chose Vue because of it's lightweightness and ease of use. The detailed documentation was one of the reasons, but the two-way binding it provides was the most crucial feature why I chose Vue for this assignment. Also, there's a large set of libraries available for different tasks like the 'wysiwyg' editor, or the wrapper for Moment.js for easy date formatting. The component based design allows reusability of the components.

Bootstrap
Bootstrap library provides an easy way to stylize the components. For this project I'm using only the bootstrap stylesheet (without js) because the functional part of the components are handled in vue.

==================

Backend
For the backend, Spring was my choice because Spring Boot offers creating production-grade Spring applications with minimum configuration. It comes with a lot of wrappers for the persistence layer which allows creating CRUD APIs really easy.

==================

Database
There were two possible options for me for building the embedded database, MongoDB and Sqlite. I choose Sqlite because of the ease of setup and the already similar syntax of SQL.
